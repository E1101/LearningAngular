  <!-- This line declares the base HTML tag. This tag is traditionally used to tell the browser -
       where to look for images and other resources declared using relative paths.
       It turns out Angular Router also relies on this tag to determine how to construct its -
       routing information. For instance, if we have a route with a path of /hello and our base -
       element declares href="/app", the application will use /app/# as the concrete path.
