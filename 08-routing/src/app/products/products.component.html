<h2>Products</h2>

<div class="navLinks">
  <!-- You can see that the route links are all in the format ['./main'], with a preceding ./
  This indicates that you want to navigate the Main route relative to the current route context.
  --
  You could also declare the routes with the ['products', 'main'] notation.
  (!) The downside is that by doing it this way, the child route is aware of the parent route -
      and if you were to move this component around or reuse it, you would have to rewrite your route links.
  --
  Letâ€™s say we want to visit the Show route, which is a child of the Product route. In this case, we -
  use ['product', 'show'] as the route definition. -->
