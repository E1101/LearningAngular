In this first section, these examples are run **outside of the browser and run by node.js**.
Because weâ€™re using TypeScript in these examples, you should run them using the commandline
tool ts-node, (instead of node directly).

_You can install ts-node by running:_

`npm install -g ts-node`

Or by doing an `npm install` in the _code/redux/redux-chat_ directory and then calling 
`./node_modules/.bin/ts-node [filename]`

For instance, to run the example above you might type (not including the $):

```
$ npm install
$ ./node_modules/.bin/ts-node 01-identity-reducer.ts
```
